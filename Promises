let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    //resolve
    //reject
})

// This function is called as Executor function
function(resolve, reject){
    //resolve
    //reject
}

//States
1. Pending- When the executor function has started the execution
2. Resolve - When the promise is resolved
3. Reject - When the promise id reject

Result: 
 1. Undefined : Initially when the state is pending
 2. Value : When the promise is resolved
 3. Error : WHen the promise is rejected

Let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject)=>{
    resolve("The promise has been resolved")
    reject("The promise has been rejected") // ignored

    resolve("The promise has been reolved again") // ignored
})
Output: The promise has been rejected . (The promsise executes once ange ignores others)

// promise handler
const pr = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // resolve("I am resolved")
    reject("I am reject")
})

// then
pr.then((result)=>{console.log(result)},
(err)=> {console.log(err)}
)

//catch
pr.catch(err=> console.log(err))

//When you have to close timers, change states, or sideEffect type of things\

pr.finally(()=>{
    clearInterval(timerId)
})
